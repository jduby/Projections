Build a retirement drawdown projection app.
The user should enter the following parameters:

- Annual rate of return (e.g. 0.055)
- Annual inflation rate (e.g. 0.03)
- Initial balances in tax-deferred, Roth, and taxable accounts
- Yearly spending amount
- Effective tax rate on withdrawals

The app should calculate yearly drawdowns from the 401(k) account, taxes owed, updated balances, percent drawn, and monthly spending amount. It should display a table of yearly projections as well as charts (e.g. line chart of account balances and pie chart of spend vs. tax).

The spreadsheet used as a model is structured as follows:
- inputs.csv contains the user input fields
- projection_template.csv shows sample output over time based on these inputs

Recreate the logic from the spreadsheet, and ensure calculations are dynamically updated based on user input. Emphasize clarity, responsive UI, and allow real-time updates. Include data validation where relevant.
